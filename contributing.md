### Design Goals
I'm no expert on events. I wrote this to solve one particular problem that I had and then figured other people might want to use it. It can definitely be made better to fit more needs.

That being said, this project has a few small design goals:
1. A simple library that can be easily added to existing projects
2. The fewer classes that need to be purpose-built to fit this lib, the better (as of this moment, only the Enum to define the states needs to be purpose-built)
3. Performance is important, but second to simplicity. I did a few things to try to make this perform as I would like it to, but any performance enhancements are welcome.

### Issues
If there is a legitmate bug, I'd really like the following to find it:
1. Steps to Reproduce
2. Test to demonstrate that problem is fixed as well as test case to demonstrate that the bug is fixed

### Pull Requests
I definitely want your PRs. If you fix something, I'd just like a nice comment about what you fixed and why it's important. If you add a feature, I'll be checking that it meets the design goals. If it breaks the design goals, I want an argument as to why the goals should be changed to accomodate. 

### To do List
The readme has a to do list that's pretty decent. I'd look there.
